Some Universals of Grammar With Particular Reference To The Order Of Meaningful Elements
===================================

Introduction
----------
* Mostly focused on morpheme and word order
* Large number of universals stated here are implicational
	1. Because many of universals are in this nature 
	2. Universals not in this nature are mostly tacitly implicational
* Not going too deeply into semantics 
* 30 Languages

Basic Order Typology 
------------------
* Some languages use post modifiers/limiters after the 
modified/limited 
	- Turkish puts adjectives before nouns they modify, dependent genetive before the noun, and tend to have postpositions
	- Thai puts adjectives after nouns they modify, dependent genetive after the noun, and tend to have prepositions
	- English is not well marked here
* Basis of classification 
	- Use of Prepositions vs post Postpositions
	- SVO order
		- Taking basic 3 types
	- Position of adjective 
		* Adj Noun - A
		* Noun Adj - N
	- 2 X 3 X 2 types = 12 Types 
		* Languages selected are distribured over these classes
	
* __Universal 1__ 
	- In declarative sentences with nominal subject and object, the dominant order is subject precedes the object 
		* Possible : SVO (II) ,SOV (III) ,VSO (I)
* __Universal 2__
	- In Languages with prepositions, the genetive almost always follow the noun, In Languages with post positions, They always precede
* __Universal 3__
	- _See table 1_
	- Languages with VSO are always prepositional

* __Universal 4__
	- Languages with SOV are normally postpositional

* __Universal 5__
	- Following the above universal and Universal 2, we may say that SOV Languages have Genetive-Noun order(GN) But, there are exceptions. Anyways, even if genetive order changes, so does the adjective order. Hence we have this universal
	- If a Language has SOV, and the order is GN then the order also is AN.
*  __Universal 6__
	- In type III languages, verb mostly follows all its modifiers. The languages which require this are a "rigid" subset of type III languages
	- All Languages with dominant VSO have SVO as Alternative
* __Universal 7__
	- All Languages with dominant SVO have OSV as Alternative

Syntax
------
* Questions 
	- Yes/No 
	- Specific question words
* __Universal 8__
	- When a yes no question is differentiated using intonation patterns, they are reckoned from end of the sentence rather than the begining.
	- Ex: English, The last sylable stressed has high intonation for yes/no questions
* Yes/No questions are sometimes differentiated by an affix or a question particle. Some languages use intonation and this approach.
* The question marker can be initial paricle or final particle. _See Table 2_
	- The marker may depend upon single word or it can be positional
* The Language may have more than one particle for that function
	- Zapotec(I/Pr) has initial particle alone or the same particle joined with the final particle.
	- Songhai(II/Po) has three such particles
		* Two initial and one final

* __Universal 9__
	- With more than chance of frequency, regarding the question particles, if the language is prepositional it has initial particle, and if it is postpositional, it has final particle.
	- _See table 2 in conjunction with table 1 for understanding this universal_ 

* __Universal 10__
	- Question particles when described in refernce to a particular word, almost always follow the word. And these do not occur in VSO type.

* In Languages involving question particle, the word order of interrogative sentences is different from that of declarative sentences.
	- English : He ate meat <=> What did he eat?
* Table 3 Lists for which languages question comes first and order is changed vs the languages where order is identical to statements

* __Universal 11__
	- Inversion of statement order that, verb precedes the subject, occurs when question word is placed at the initial position. Also, the inversion occurs for yes-no questions only if it occurs for interrogative _word_ questions.
	- _See table 3_

* __Universal 12__
	- If language is VSO, it puts question words before. If it is SOV it does not.
	- _From Table 3_

* __Universal 13__
	- If the object precedes the main verb, then subordinating verbs also precede the main verb.
	- _See [2]_

* __Universal 14__
	- In conditional statements, condition always precedes the consequence
	- True for all the 30 languages
	- _See [3]_ 

* __Universal 15__
	- In volition and purpose, the subordinate verb always follows the main verb. Except SOV
	- _See [4]_

* __Universal 16__
	- If language is VSO, _inflected_ auxillary always precedes the verb. If it is SOV, it always follows the verb.
	- _From table 4_

* __Universal 17__
	- With overwhelmingly more than chance of frequency, adjectives tend to follow the noun in VSO
	- _From Table 5_
	- 19 Languages - AN, 11 Languages - NA 
* __Universal 18__
	- When Adjective precedes the noun, the demonstratives and numerals, generally do the same
	- _From Table 6_
	- _See [5]_

* __Universal 19__
	- When the general rule is that, a descriptive adjective follows a noun, there are a few exceptions. But, if it precedes, there are no exceptions

* __Universal 20__
	- When any or all of the items(Demonstratives,numerals,adjectives) precede noun, they are always found in that order. If they follow, they are found in same order or exact opposite
	- Ex: These Five Beautiful Lilies
* __Universal 21__
	- If the adverb follows the adjective, and Adjective follows noun, then in that language, verb is followed by the nominal object
	- _From Table 7_

* Less languages like english have comparative inflections. Many languages have seperate word modifiers
	- "John is taller than Jackob"
	- "John is more tall than Jackob"
	- "Marie est plus grand que sophie"
* Adjective, Marker of Comparision, Standard of comparision
	- Taller(Adjective) than(Marker) Jackob(Standard)

* __Universal 22__
	- If the comparision order is standard-marker-adjective, the language is post positional. Other wise it is prepositional
	- _From Table 8_

* __Universal 23__
	- The proper noun follows the common noun in NG languages. It is reverse in GN languages.
	- _From Table 9_


* __Universal 24__
	- If a relative expression precedes the noun, then the language is postpositional or it is a AN Language.
	- _From Table 10_
		* Exception - Chinese which is a prepositional language but it is a AN language

* Pronouns exhibit differences whrn compared to the nouns. 
	- Ex: "je vois l'homme" - I see the man
		* Nominal object follows the verb
	- "Je le vois" - I see that/him 
		* Pronominal object precedes
	- Italian, Greek, Swahili
	- The pronominal object never follows, but the nominal object can follow or precede.

* __Universal 25__
	- If pronominal object follows the verb, then so does the nominal object.

Morphology
---------
* Based on Inflectional Categories
* Ambifixing
	- Ex: Semitic
	- Preceding affix, succeding affix combined.
	- Discontinuos
* __Universal 26__
	- If a language has discontinuous affixes, it has prefixes or suffixes or both.

* Of the two, Exclusively suffixing languages are more than Exclusively prefixing languages

* __Universal 27__
	-If a language is exclusively suffixing, it is postpostional else if it is exclusively prefixing it is prepositional

* __Universal 28__
	- If a word form has both inflection and derivation, then the derivation is closer to the root

* __Universal 29__
	- If a language has inflection, it has derivation

* There are languages without inflection

* __Universal 30__
	- If language has number-person or gender categories it always has TAM

* __Universal 31__
	- If subject or object agrees with gender of the verb, the adjective agrees with the noun 
	- _Need Example_
* __Universal 32__
	- When verb agrees with the nominal subject or object in the gender, it agrees in number
* __Universal 33__
	- When number agreement is suspended btw noun and verb. The verb is singular and verb precedes
	- _Need Example_
* __Universal 34__
	- No language has trial number unless it has dual. No Language has dual unless it has plural.
* __Universal 35__
	- There is no language where plural does not have some nonzero allomorphs. In some languages singular is expressed by zero, but dual and trail are almost never expressed by zero.
	- _See [7]_

* __Universal 36__
	- If language has category number, it alwasy has category gender

* __Universal 37__
	- A language has no more gender categories in plural than in singular.
	- We may have masculine, feminine in singular but not in plural but the vice versa is not possible

* __Universal 38__
	- Did not understand
* __Universal 39__
	- When there are number and case morphemes, number comes always between noun and case morphemes
* __Universal 40__
	- When adjective follows the noun, the adjective covers all the inflections of the noun. In such cases, the noun may miss some inflections.
	- But then, how do we identify the noun?
* __Universal 41__
	- If the language is SOV, it almost always has a case system 
* __Universal 42__
	- All languages have pronominal categories involving at least three persons and two numbers.
* __Universal 43__
	- If a language has gender categories in the noun, it also has it in pronouns 
* __Universal 44__
	- If language has gender categories in 1st person, it always has in 2nd or 3rd person or both.
* __Universal 45__
	- If there are gender distinctions in plural pronouns, there are gender distinctions in singular also.
Stuff to know
-----------
1. Genetives
	- Dependent Genetive 
		* Noun follows it 
		* We met caroline's pet
	- Independent
		* Noun does not follow
		* We went in that car of sham's 

2. Main verb vs Subordinate verb
	- Batman says that he needs a special key for the Batmobile.
	- says is main, needs is subordinate
	- In Telugu(Po/III) need(kAvAlani) precedes the verb says(annADu) 

3. Conditional sentence
	- If it rains {condition}, `(`then`)` the picnic will be cancelled {consequence}
	- If condition`(`Protasis`)` then consequence `(`Apodosis`)`
4. Voilition 
	* To mark whether subject did something purposefully. 
	* Hindi 
		- Ram Khasa vs Ram ne Khasa
		- Ram ne Khasa marks the volition
5. Demonstratives
	- This house is nice, I want those

6. Relative Clause
	- Modifies the noun 
	- "I saw the man who came yesterday"
7. Allomorphs
	- Difference in sounds but not in meanings
		- a,an 
		- with plural marker 's','ies', singular,plural words are allomorphs because basic meaning is not changed
	- Zero allomorphs 
		- Sheep ( sing ), Sheep + null ( plural )
8. Intransitive verb
	- Doesnt have a direct object
	- Ex: "Let's Run!"
	- Ergative Verb
		- Can be Transitive/Intransitive
* Nonfinite verb forms
* Gerundives
